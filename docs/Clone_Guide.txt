# Cloning and Managing a GitHub Repo Across Machines

## ✅ Why Clone a Repo on Another Machine?

You should clone a repository to another device when:
- 🔁 You want to continue development on a different computer
- 🧪 You need to test your install instructions or behavior in a clean environment
- 💥 Your original machine is lost or damaged (disaster recovery)
- 🤝 You're collaborating with others who need their own local copy
- 💻 You're switching platforms (e.g., Windows to Mac)

## 🛠️ How to Clone

1. Open a terminal or Git-enabled shell on the second device
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project
3. Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/D29197/ninjatrader-indicators.git
```

This creates a complete copy with:
- All code
- Version history
- Tags (like `v1.0`)
- Branches (defaults to `main`)

## 💡 Other Considerations

- You can work offline after cloning, then sync with `git push`
- Make sure Git is installed (`git --version`)
- If using SSH instead of HTTPS, configure your SSH keys
